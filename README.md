# Servo Motor Integration

This documentation provides guidance on integrating the MG90S servo motor with an Arduino Uno. The servo motor is programmed to rotate from 0 to 180 degrees and then back to 0 degrees, with a delay of 15 milliseconds between movements, resulting in a continuous back-and-forth motion.
